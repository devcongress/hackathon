Hi <%= @owner.profile.name %>,

We're excited to let you know that <%= @team.name %> has met the minimum membership requirement and is now late-qualified for UNICEF StartUp Lab Hack! 🎉


What Does Late-Qualified Mean?
==============================

Due to overwhelming interest, we've reached the maximum team threshold for the event.
While your team has met the minimum requirements, your participation will depend on availability if any registered teams drop out or fail to complete their registration.
So be on the lookout in your inbox.


What's Next?
============

1️⃣ Stay prepared: Ensure all team members complete their profiles here: 🔗 Team Dashboard Portal: <%= @dashboard_portal_url %>
2️⃣ Review event rules: Familiarize your team with guidelines and schedules.
3️⃣ Finalize details: Update your team name or project idea in your dashboard if needed.

We'll notify you if a spot opens up and your team is selected to participate.

Key Details to Keep in Mind
===========================

🗓 Event kickoff: <%= ApplicationMailer.event_date %> | <%= ApplicationMailer.event_time %>
